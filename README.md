This script is meant to prove that using only two items/objects in Rock Paper Scissors has the highest winning rate.
Using any of the three items allows a chance of winning of 1/3. But choosing two items only, allows a chance of winning of 2/3.

It is mostly a practice to learn programming, but feel free to add, modify or provide feedback on it. Any comments would be highly appreciated.
